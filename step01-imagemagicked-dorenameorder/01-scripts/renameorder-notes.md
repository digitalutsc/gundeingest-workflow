renaming recto verso books with roman numeral pages is a scary dream.

gundegunde book tiffs will be ingest in alphabetical sequential order. these individual files need to be renamed to get the correct page order.

when you’re done move to next folder for next step
===================================================================
# manual rename order

do the rename with namechanger:	

001	fc

002	frontpage/firstpage
003	ir

004	iv
005	iir

006	iiv
007	iiir

008	iiiv
009	ivr

010	ivv
011	vr

012	vv
013	vir

014	viv
015	viir

016	viiv
017	viiir

018	viiiv

no need to rename: bc, be, endpage, fe, mdc/mde, sp, te

delete random folders
delete thumbs, docx, tmp and random files, gz, zip files, .ink
delete duplicate images

check for random folders	
find all items not folder or tif
find folders and clean

36, 37, 38 are numbered perfectly.  issues where iv, v may be at end not beginning but how will i know?
i'm starting to think iiir, iiiv and afterwards should all be at the end

i, ii, iii are usually in front, iv, v and after will be at the end (but it's definitely not all the same.  you can tell by pages behind it if you can see the cover).  

# what i'm doing now is just naming up to iiv

# do a manual check after rename to find all the folders/junk files

================================================================================
# rename order notes

prepend 00x

### search backwards so that you don't rename ir as an iiir (etc). for iiir, iiiv first, then iir, iiv, then ir, iv and ignore the nuns
then search for viiir, viid, vir, vr versos

be careful - missingpage, skipped page.  put at top or bottom?


you can batch rename all like these headers then look through manually and fig out what to do per case

### after the batch rename with finder, do a manual review of each folder to make sure no images were missed in the rename

================================================================================

# pages on the correct side
see that the recto verso binding matches up together. in islandora the first page is the recto right side, open up and you’ll have the first verso-recto view, meaning:


01
1r

02-03
1v-2r

04-05
2v-3r

06-07
3v-4r

therefore odd numbers should be recto, even numbers should be verso
================================================================================

## even verso left, odd recto right



1r
RIGHT

1v-2r
LEFT-RIGHT

2v-3r
LEFT-RIGHT


================================================================================

you can leave other page tiffs as is (including fe, mdc, te).  here's an example:
